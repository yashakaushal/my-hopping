## User Input 

As soon as the program starts running, there are a few inputs which are to be given by the user:
1. 'Name of the target' : Enter the common name of the object you want to hop to (if any) or hit enter 
2. 'RA/DEC of the target': Enter the J2000 RA/DEC coordinates of the object you want to hop to in this format. Example: '200/20' This will appear as a yellow mark in the plot.
3. 'Limiting Magnitude of the target' : Enter the maximum 'V' band AB apparent magnitude of the objects visible in the plot. Should be a positive integer.
